# tsp_ml
The goal of this repository is to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) with Machine Learning (ML) methods.

## Installation

[Optional] It is recommended that you install the dependencies in a virtual environment. To do so, you can use the command in the 'create_venv.sh' file.

You can install the dependencies by running the install_dependencies.sh bash script:
```bashrc
sh install_dependencies.sh
```

Or by using pip to install the dependencies specified in the 'requirements.txt' file:
```bashrc
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To test the installation, you can run the 'import_test.py' script:
```bashrc
python3 tsp_ml/import_test.py
```
If there are no errors and the script prints a message saying that all imports worked, the installation is complete!
